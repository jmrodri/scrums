*Friday & Weekend*:
- Spent the day trying to debug why changes to proxy config were not restarting
  service catalog. Turns out I had an old version of openshift/api. Updating
  that dependency turned into an epic update of the svcat operator:
  https://github.com/openshift/cluster-svcat-controller-manager-operator/pull/43

*Today*:
- Mike Dame came to answer my question with a complete PR to supercede the one I
  did this weekend:
  https://github.com/openshift/cluster-svcat-controller-manager-operator/pull/44
- Review PRs by Mike to fix the operator update PRs:
  - https://github.com/openshift/cluster-svcat-controller-manager-operator/pull/44
  - https://github.com/openshift/cluster-svcat-controller-manager-operator/pull/45
- still focused on proxy stuff
  - building and testing, hoping to post PR tonight

*Blockers*:
- None
